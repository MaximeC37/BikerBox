## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Active Development
This project is currently under development and not yet finalized. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change.
Current version: Alpha 0.2

## About
BikerBox is a personal mobile application project under development, designed for bikers. This application is a prototype/technical demonstrator developed for learning purposes and experimentation with Kotlin Multiplatform and Jetpack Compose. It simulates a secure locker management system allowing bikers to store their equipment (helmets, jackets, etc.).

## üèó Architecture
This personal project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and is structured in several layers:
- **data**: Repositories and data sources
- **domain**: Models and use cases
- **ui**: Screens and user interface components
- **di**: Dependency injection
- **utils**: Utilities and extensions

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Kotlin Multiplatform 2.2.0** - For code sharing between platforms
- **Compose Multiplatform 1.8.2** - For user interface
- **Firebase** - For authentication and data storage
- **Koin** - For dependency injection
- **Kotlin Coroutines** - For asynchronous programming
- **Kotlin Flow** - For reactive programming
- **Lifecycle 2.9.1** - For lifecycle management

## üåç Localization
The app now features a complete localization system:
- All UI text is externalized to string resources
- Consistent English translation throughout the application
- Easy to extend for additional languages
- Improved maintainability and translation management

## üí≥ Payment Integration
Supports multiple payment methods with visual branding:
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay
- Visa
- Mastercard
- PayPal

## üìà Recent Updates
- **v0.2**: Complete UI localization, enhanced payment flow, improved reservation system
- **v0.1**: Initial release with basic authentication and navigation

## üéØ Project Goals
This personal project was developed with the aim of:
- Exploring Kotlin Multiplatform capabilities
- Experimenting with Jetpack Compose
- Putting MVVM architecture principles into practice
- Creating a technical demonstration of a modern mobile application
- Implementing modern UI/UX patterns and localization best practices
